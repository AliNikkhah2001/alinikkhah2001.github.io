## About Ali

I am Ali Nikkhah—an applied machine learning researcher and engineering lead based in Tehran. I specialise in
transforming state-of-the-art multimodal, agentic, and retrieval-augmented methods into resilient production
systems. My current focus spans generative voice translation, enterprise RAG control planes, ultrasound-report
automation, and motion understanding. Whether embedded with a founding team or guiding an enterprise research
lab, I translate ambitious research questions into scalable platforms with compliance, observability, and
human-in-the-loop review baked in from day zero.

## Career Thread

- **Turquoise Digital** — Senior Data Scientist (previously Data Scientist) guiding multilingual recommendation
  and content-quality programs for retailers across the region.
- **Trinity College Dublin** — Machine Learning Researcher on the EmoDub project, building emotion-aware speech
  translation agents with transformer SER modules, multimodal fusion, and MOS/E-F1 evaluation loops.
- **University of British Columbia** — Ultrasound report generation researcher pairing BLIP/ViT encoders with T5
  heads, clinician dashboards, and saliency overlays for diagnostic trust.
- **Digikala** — AI Engineering R/D Lead (previously AI Engineer) running modular control pipelines and RAG
  infrastructures for high-volume marketplace listings.
- **L3S Research Center** — Video motion classification research assistant studying texture-free
  representations and transformer-based action recognition.
- **Sharif University of Technology** — Teaching Assistant across ten graduate and undergraduate courses
  including NLP, Generative Models, Deep Learning, and Data Science while completing my B.Sc. in Electrical
  Engineering.

## How I Operate

- **Systems architecture** — Kubernetes, Argo, and Terraform-first infrastructure, feature stores, and MLflow
  governance for reproducibility.
- **Applied research** — Diffusion, multimodal representation learning, speech emotion recognition, and
  retrieval strategies across voice, vision, and text.
- **Leadership** — Mentoring applied researchers, running experimentation boards, and partnering with legal,
  product, and operations stakeholders to meet regulatory requirements.
