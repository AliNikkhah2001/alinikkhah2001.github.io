## About Ali

I am an applied-machine-learning researcher focused on building elegant, trustworthy systems that operate in regulated, multilingual
markets. My career has been spent launching agentic platforms that combine retrieval-augmented generation, multimodal perception,
and rigorous evaluation frameworks so that organisations can automate content creation and review without compromising compliance.

At Sharif University of Technology I studied electrical and electronics engineering, where I led research on generative models and
vision-language alignment. Since then, I have supported product, legal, and engineering teams across Europe and the Middle East as a
fractional lead, helping them move from prototype to resilient production services.

## What I Do

- **Systems architecture** &mdash; Kubernetes-native control planes, Terraform-managed infrastructure, and observability foundations that
  keep models shippable.
- **Applied research** &mdash; Diffusion pipelines, speech-to-speech translation, multimodal retrieval, and governance for sensitive data.
- **Leadership** &mdash; Mentoring engineers and researchers, shaping experimentation rituals, and aligning stakeholders around responsible AI.
