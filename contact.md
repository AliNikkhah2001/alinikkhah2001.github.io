I'm a **machine learning researcher and engineer** focused on multimodal AI, agentic systems, and clinical intelligence. I'm currently **seeking master's or PhD placements** and I'm equally eager to co-author papers, build shared datasets, or embed with teams that need applied research horsepower. Drop a note any time—email is fastest, but I'm reachable everywhere below.
