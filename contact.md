As a machine learning researcher / engineer, I'm actively seeking master's or PhD opportunities in multimodal AI, affective computing, and agentic systems. I'm equally motivated to co-author papers, prototype joint experiments, and support labs that need hands-on engineering depth. If you share these interests, please drop me a note—I'd love to hear about your roadmap.

I respond quickest via email and remain open to synchronous discussions or async document reviews—especially if they involve graduate placements or research collaborations in AI/ML.
