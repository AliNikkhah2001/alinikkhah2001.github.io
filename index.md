    I specialise in transforming state-of-the-art multimodal, agentic, and retrieval-augmented methods into
    resilient production systems. From multilingual marketplaces to clinical reporting labs, I architect pipelines
    that autonomously generate, moderate, and enrich millions of artefacts while remaining explainable and
    regulation-ready.

  I am an applied machine learning researcher and engineer who is endlessly enthusiastic about multimodal AI, affective computing, and autonomous evaluation systems. My work blends rigorous research with production-grade engineering so ideas move quickly from controlled studies into platforms serving clinicians, linguists, and marketplace operators.

  I am actively seeking master's or PhD positions in these domains and I'm always open to research collaborations or co-authored publications that push the boundaries of speech, vision-language, and agentic ML systems.
