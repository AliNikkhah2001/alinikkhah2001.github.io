# Ali Nikkhah

Welcome to my personal site! I am an applied‑machine‑learning researcher and engineering lead who specialises in transforming state‑of‑the‑art methods into robust, production‑grade systems. My work focuses on architecting agentic, multi‑modal pipelines that autonomously generate, moderate and enrich millions of product listings in real‑time — achieving substantial gains in content quality, regulatory compliance and operational expenditure.
