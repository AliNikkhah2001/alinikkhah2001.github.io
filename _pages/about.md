Welcome to my personal webpage! I'm a 22-year-old engineering student at Sharif University of Technology, specializing in digital systems within the field of electrical engineering. 
From a young age, I’ve been captivated by problem-solving and engineering, starting my programming journey even before mastering writing in my native language. 
My passion lies in research areas like artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing, as well as the design and implementation of digital systems, including ASICs and FPGAs. 
I’ve collaborated on diverse projects such as Spread Time CDMA digital chip design, texture-free video classification using transformers, and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for investment strategies. 
Alongside, I’ve had the privilege of working as a research and teaching assistant for esteemed professors. 
Currently, I’m seeking PhD opportunities to deepen my journey in impactful research and contribute meaningfully to the world.
