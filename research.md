This notebook highlights the programs and questions I am actively exploring. My research practice balances rigorous experimentation with deployable systems that partner with clinicians, linguists, and product leaders.

## Emotion-aware speech translation
- **Lab:** Trinity College Dublin · EmoDub Project
- **Focus:** Preserving affect during multilingual speech-to-speech translation.
- Engineered speech emotion recognition front-ends that blend wav2vec2.0, Whisper, and transformer SER encoders.
- Built multimodal fusion stacks to align acoustic, semantic, and contextual signals for affect-consistent decoding.
- Evaluated BLEU, Emotion F1, and MOS to quantify emotional fidelity alongside translation accuracy.

## Ultrasound report generation
- **Lab:** University of British Columbia
- **Focus:** Automated drafting of ultrasound narratives with trustworthy language models.
- Coupled ViT/BLIP vision encoders with T5 generation heads to produce structured, clinician-ready summaries.
- Curated DICOM-compliant datasets, performed careful de-identification, and integrated saliency overlays for interpretability.
- Collaborated with radiologists to benchmark BLEU, ROUGE-L, and clinical efficacy metrics before deployment.

## Texture-free motion intelligence
- **Lab:** L3S Research Center
- **Focus:** Domain-robust action understanding free from scene texture bias.
- Designed optical-flow-first datasets and augmentations that emphasise temporal cues over backgrounds.
- Trained hybrid 3D CNN and transformer models to generalise across lighting, texture, and capture conditions.
- Analysed attention maps and counterfactuals to explain decisions for reviewers and industry partners.

## Open collaboration
I maintain reproducible codebases for each program—agentic evaluation harnesses, data cards, and experiment logs live on GitHub—and I'm eager to co-author papers that explore multimodal alignment, affective computing, and applied clinical AI.
